A login for Termux for security (nope this is unsecure)
Written in C.
I am new with C, please tell me bugs.
This project is just me learning C.
# Installation
Compile the .c file or just run the executable.
# Warning
You can just ctrl-d and bypass it. (fixed)

Password is unencrypted (I tested encryption code but wont compile, idk how to fix)

There is no sleep after wrong password, I tried but it breaks program badly.
# Why release this unfinished?
it is working prototype, i might re write this in go
